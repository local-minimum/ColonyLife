# Todo

## Performance

* Simplify physics
 * Write own Rigidbody?

## Biology

* Report the cycle of current experiment
* Make nutrient selection stronger
* Nutrient either decay with number of times eaten or with time/population size

## Style

* Have phase between transfers where you see two pages of book
* Make lab notebook feel
 * One page when simulating, two between batches 
* Make microscope be on right side
 * More vinergetting
* Test making icons feel like LED icons instead and make batch symbol an e-flask
