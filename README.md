Gamefication of my PhD studying yeast growth

# Todo

## Performance

* Make nutrient collision a Coroutine and update the current state at lower intervals
 * Make nutrient have type-index and lookup be on a bool array if calculated and corresponding float array for value
* Simplify physics
 * Lock all rotations
 * Test using box colliders
 * Write on Rigidbody?

## Biology

* Make notebook feel
* Have phase between transfers where you see two pages of book
* Make nutrient selection stronger
