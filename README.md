# Todo

## Performance

* Make nutrient collision a Coroutine and update the current state at lower intervals
 * Make nutrient have type-index and lookup be on a bool array if calculated and corresponding float array for value
* Simplify physics
 * Lock all rotations
 * Test using box colliders
 * Write on Rigidbody?

## Biology

* Have phase between transfers where you see two pages of book
* Make nutrient selection stronger

## Style

* Make lab notebook feel
 * One page when simulating, two between batches 
* Make microscope be on right side
 * More vinergetting
* Test making icons feel like LED icons instead and make batch symbol an e-flask
